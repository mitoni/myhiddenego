            Welcome to My Hidden Ego, a transformative project conceived by
            Monica Silva, where the camera lens becomes a portal to
            self-discovery and empowerment. At the heart of MHE lies the
            profound belief in the power of art, particularly therapeutic
            photography, to illuminate our best selves, fostering a deep journey
            toward greater self-esteem and inner acceptance.

              "My Hidden Ego" is more than just a photography project; it's a
              vehicle for enhancing self-esteem. The project delves into the
              transformative power of photography in boosting self-confidence.
              Being photographed with empathy and understanding not only
              captures the physical image but also reflects the inner essence of
              each individual. Through the expert eyes of the photographer,
              layers of insecurity are stripped away, revealing the intrinsic
              beauty of every person.
            </p>
            <p>
              The process of being seen and accepted for who we truly are can be
              transformative, offering validation, affirmation, and a sense of
              belonging. A portrait in the hands of an empathetic photographer
              becomes a catalyst for self-discovery and acceptance. Sharing
              one's portrait with others can inspire connection and empathy,
              creating space for genuine human understanding. Ultimately, the
              portrait becomes a powerful tool for promoting self-love and
              acceptance, encouraging individuals to embrace their uniqueness
              and worth. The emergence of self-respect and individuality
              captured by the lens is revealed in the portrait, becoming a
              celebration of the dignity and intrinsic value of every human
              being.

            In "Women Thru the Lens" and "Changing Partner Without Changing
            Partner" sessions, the artist uses makeup and styling to help
            subjects reveal their inner selves. This method, does not mean the
            disappearance of the identity recognized by society or oneself but
            rather opposes the fragmentation of the self, which causes feelings
            of inadequacy, insufficiency, and loss that increasingly
            characterize our time. These sessions address issues related to the
            nature of truth and knowledge and how our perception of reality can
            be distorted by personal psychological projections and social
            conventions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project unfolds in two dynamics: Social identity is explored in
            the public performance session "15 Minutes to Be Real," where the
            individuals are captured as they are, free from artistic
            interpretations or interventions, capturing the image we present to
            the external world. We are accustomed to a society that leverages
            diversity as a divisive element; the project's intent is to offer a
            different vision: starting from the premise that we are all
            different, we are united when we accept our own and others'
            diversity.

              Monica Silva, the visionary artist and creator of MHE, promotes
              the fusion of therapeutic photography masterclasses with specially
              curated motivational kits designed to provide valuable
              psychological support. Our mission transcends conventional
              boundaries; it’s about nurturing self-esteem, unveiling the
              complexities of one's personality, embracing individuality, and
              fortifying psychological resilience through the transformative
              power of art. At the core of MHE's ethos is the awareness that its
              impact goes far beyond the individual. It’s a ripple effect, a
              shared journey where art connects to humanity. Although Monica
              Silva’s personal history fueled the birth of MHE, its essence lies
              in enabling others to harness their creative potential and share
              the collective healing journey. MHE is more than a project; it's a
              testament to the transformative power of resilience and human
              connection. It’s a collaborative effort, a testimony to the
              collective strength of individuals united by a shared vision of
              healing through art. Join us as we embark on a journey of
              self-discovery, empowerment, and collective healing. Together, we
              uncover the hidden depths of our true selves and embrace the
              beauty of our shared humanity. In the captivating images of Monica
              Silva, we find an intense journey of resilience and
              self-discovery. With each shutter click, the artist transcends the
              boundaries of her past, weaving a mosaic of emotions and
              experiences that resonate with the human soul of those before her.
              Monica's artistic journey testifies to the transformative power of
              photography. Her life has been marked by an abusive and violent
              childhood, and her camera has become a gateway to liberation and
              healing. Through the lens, she found solace, creating a sacred
              space to confront the many souls residing within her. For Monica,
              photography is more than a skill; it’s a lifeline, a means to
              survive in a world demanding strength and invincibility. It’s a
              journey of self-discovery, an exploration of identity in an era
              dominated by images and illusions. Navigating the complexities of
              contemporary society, Monica's work serves as a beacon of hope,
              reminding us that culture has the power to redeem and restore.
              Through her lens, she invites us to embrace vulnerability,
              confront our deepest demons, and emerge stronger and more
              resilient than ever. Join Monica Silva on a journey of
              self-discovery and redemption: a journey where every image tells a
              story and every soul finds solace in the beauty of art.

              The MHE Project is conceived as a format that can be implemented
              anywhere in the world. Our goal is to make the project itinerant,
              starting from Italy, travelling far and wide, and then continuing
              our journey through Europe and the rest of the world.
