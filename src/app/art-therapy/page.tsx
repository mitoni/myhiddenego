            "Therapeutic" photography, according to the psychoanalytic model, is
            a very useful path both to become more aware of one's physical
            identity and as an aid to strengthen one's self-esteem. The
            self-portrait has always been part of human rituals, whether those
            portraits were painted, filmed or photographed. In most
            self-portraits, the components for a shot are, most often: a neutral
            background, the subject, the camera, and, the implicit and
            fundamental element for the creation of a self-portrait, the mirror.
            This last is an object that has continually stimulated the
            observation and thoughts of psychologists and psychoanalysts, in
            particular, of Jacques Lacan, who legitimately named one of the
            phases of man's psychic development the "Mirror stage".

            To survive, man has long understood that he must become immortal,
            that he must overcome the limits of human consciousness without
            worrying about common sense or logic. However, he must also remember
            that he is not invincible and that a mere micro organism is enough
            to put his security in question. Knowing this, he is forced to
            re-prioritize this life.

              “My images partly reflect my difficult past which I transform each
              time into something eternal and unforgettable. Photography for me
              goes far beyond holding a camera in my hand and knowing how to use
              it. It was of therapeutic help and created the opportunity to
              observe the thousand souls that live within me. Photography has
              helped me exit a world full of abuse and violence on my body ever
              since my childhood. I was able to create my own secret space, a
              world in which I am my master, free to dream. Thanks to
              photography, I learned to survive in an era where society requires
              us to be strong, invincible and successful. In the contemporary
              world in which we live, the addiction to images leaves us orphaned
              from our identity. Fortunately, there is culture, the only way
              capable of redeeming man.”

              Luckily, there is culture, the only thing capable of redeeming
              mankind. Monica Silva investigates the various psychological
              aspects of the self-portrait, having started with herself when she
              placed the camera on the tripod and took one picture a week in an
              effort to understand her identity during a moment of personal
              loss. After a few months, she found women literally unknown to
              her, who, to her surprise, were none other than herself in
              different phases of her daily life. These images were accompanied
              by a diary where she collected texts and thoughts on her emotional
              state and it was then that she understood fully the power of
              photography..

              Thus began her in-depth theoretical research on the subject of the
              portrait, discovering that she was not the only person in history
              to investigate their own soul, their own identity. Albrecht Dürer,
              Adelaide Labille-Guiard, Andy Warhol, Caravaggio, Francis Bacon,
              Lee Friedlander, Gustave Coubert, Francesca Woodman, and Artemisia
              Gentileschi, just to name a famous few, have also explored the art
              of self-portraiture. In a society where facade is imposed as a
              form of identity, together with the myth of personal affirmation,
              what is the boundary between the sacredness of existence and the
              desecration of social rituals? This is the theme that Monica Silva
              has explored through her own experience and, intrigued and
              fascinated by photography as a mending art, she has collected over
              time a vast archive of testimonies and composed various texts on
              the subject of self-portraiture. She has also conducted many
              conferences and workshops in Italy and abroad on the subject of
              therapeutic photography.

            Between 2010 and 2011, the artist emerged from contemplating theory
            to stage an ambitious project entitled MY HIDDEN EGO, in search of a
            secret “I”, one that is hidden from most people and perhaps even
            from themselves. With My Hidden Ego, Silva entered the experimental
            here-and-now and, using various media, investigated the psychology
            of the person, revealing the secret, hidden sides of the subjects
            chosen for her shots. Thirty photographs of various personalities
            were taken against a white background and portrayed in two versions:
            one shot portraying the social ego, or how the subject presents
            himself to the judgment of others; the second revealing another ego,
            kept inside, whether a different personality or an expression of the
            desire to be someone else. Two shots: one for objective, actual
            reality and one for the potential in being exposed to the public,
            shared in an exhibition with interactive installations at Palazzo
            Pichi Sforza, Sansepolcro.

            “Every morning you look in the mirror and what you see collides with
            the image you have of yourself, with the image that others have of
            you, with an ideal of a dominant personality in society". The
            self-portrait, from the ancient myth of Narcissus to Durer’s
            so-called "self-portraits of Christ", continues to spread among
            contemporary artists and proves the act of portraying oneself is
            part of a centuries-long tradition. It is the artistic genre that
            best distinguishes our era; man has reached the maximum saturation
            of the ego even if, going deeper, we discover that every human being
            since the dawn of time has been seduced by the autobiographical
            impulse, using every means to leave a trace of himself in this land.

            Modern artists are a long way from exhausting the strength and
            potential of the self-portrait and when the self-portrait is used
            not for a foolish game of vanity, but for a serious journey of
            exploration, self-inquiry and self-awareness, it becomes a healing
            tool for the soul. It is an excellent exercise, that of
            investigating one's inner reality, as after a profound
            self-analysis, one is able to shape the expressiveness of the soul.
            Because, after all, photographing others with one's own vision is a
            real and true “selfie,” a "mirror" on the subject. 'The Vitalism',
            the continuous change from one state to another, leads one to
            believe that they are "one" both for themselves and for the people
            around them, but the truth is that there are many different people
            in each of us depending on who is watching. One image tells much
            more than we know about ourselves; it is enough to wait a while
            before reviewing one of our photographs to grasp the nuances of
            which we were not aware before. In short, the self-portrait is an
            inspiring symbol of artistic freedom, an opportunity to investigate
            one's self but also a symptom of what has been characterized as the
            "culture of narcissism”.

              Portraiture is more than just capturing a face. It represents an
              entire life. This is why it is an important aspect in declaring
              the existence of a person. The portrait is a necessity, a latent
              desire to counteract the erosive and destructive action of time.
              Shaping the expressiveness of the soul is to use photography as a
              tool for revealing the forms of the personality. Here the
              photographer's task is not only to document - nor to capture just
              another essence of the subject - but above all to bring it to
              light in a personal way and to reveal it to the subject himself.
              Artists have the ability to see the present moment as if it were
              already part of the past, transforming scenes into eternal art.
            </p>
            <p>
              Photography serves, consciously or not, as doors to accessibility,
              in order to better explore and communicate affections, emotions,
              and desires.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ability to grasp the non-evident part of the subject's
              character is in fact a gift, but also a quest. To grasp the soul
              of those who let themselves be portrayed and being able to shape
              the subject to bring out an "another character" is both a gift and
              the dream of every photographer.

              brief, intense intimacy. But it’s unearned. It has no past...no
